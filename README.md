# X16-Labyrinth
A BASIC game for the Commander X16

The original code used is the Labyrinth program created by an unknown 
programmer at Commodore around 1982. The program was included on a floppy disk
"64DEMO"

The code was changed to remove basText / PETSCI control characters and explicit
CHR$ codes were used.

I will then try to work out some of the strange code and comment it.
Following that I will try and optimise the code.
